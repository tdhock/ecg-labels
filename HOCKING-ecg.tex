  \caption{\label{fig:ecg} In these electrocardiogram data, it is
    important for models (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) to accurately detect
    the QRS complex (Q is before the peak, R is the peak marked in
    \textcolor{red}{red}, S is the local minimum after the
    peak). \textbf{Top:} Previous model of \citet{PanTompkins1985}
    mistakenly predicts S at the peak. \textbf{Bottom:} proposed
    constrained changepoint model using a graph with 9 vertices
    accurately predicts R at each peak.}

      models (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) to accurately detect the QRS
      complex (Q is before the peak, R is the peak marked in

      Below each edge $e$ we show the penalty $\lambda_e$, which is
      either a constant $\lambda>0$ or zero if nothing is shown; above
      we show the constants $\delta_e,\gamma_e$ in the constraint
      function
      $g_e(m_i,m_{i+1})= \delta_e(m_i - m_{i+1})+\gamma_e\leq 0$
      ($\delta_e=1$ for a non-decreasing change, $\delta_e=-1$ for a
      non-increasing change, $\gamma_e \geq 0$ is the minimum
      magnitude of change).
