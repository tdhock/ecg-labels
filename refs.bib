 abstract = {The Lasso is a very well-known penalized regression model, which adds an Lâ‚ penalty with parameter Î»â‚ on the coefficients to the squared error loss function. The Fused Lasso extends this model by also putting an Lâ‚ penalty with parameter Î»â‚‚ on the difference of neighboring coefficients, assuming there is a natural ordering. In this article, we develop a path algorithm for solving the Fused Lasso Signal Approximator that computes the solutions for all values of Î»â‚ and Î»â‚‚. We also present an approximate algorithm that has considerable speed advantages for a moderate trade-off in accuracy. In the Online Supplement for this article, we provide proofs and further details for the methods developed in the article.},

	abstract = {To understand how the brain processes sensory information to guide behavior, we must know how stimulus representations are transformed throughout the visual cortex. Here we report an open, large-scale physiological survey of neural activity in the awake mouse visual cortex: the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset. This publicly available dataset includes cortical activity from nearly 60,000 neurons collected from 6 visual areas, 4 layers, and 12 transgenic mouse lines from 221 adult mice, in response to a systematic set of visual stimuli. Using this dataset, we reveal functional differences across these dimensions and show that visual cortical responses are sparse but correlated. Surprisingly, responses to different stimuli are largely independent, e.g. whether a neuron responds to natural scenes provides no information about whether it responds to natural movies or to gratings. We show that these phenomena cannot be explained by standard local filter-based models, but are consistent with multi-layer hierarchical computation, as found in deeper layers of standard convolutional neural networks.},

pages = {2344-2349}, 
year = {2008}, 
abstract ={Motivation: Epigenetic modifications are one of the critical factors to regulate gene expression and genome function. Among different epigenetic modifications, the differential histone modification sites (DHMSs) are of great interest to study the dynamic nature of epigenetic and gene expression regulations among various cell types, stages or environmental responses. To capture the histone modifications at whole genome scale, ChIP-seq technology is becoming a robust and comprehensive approach. Thus the DHMSs are potentially identifiable by comparing two ChIP-seq libraries. However, little has been addressed on this issue in literature.Results: Aiming at identifying DHMSs, we propose an approach called ChIPDiff for the genome-wide comparison of histone modification sites identified by ChIP-seq. Based on the observations of ChIP fragment counts, the proposed approach employs a hidden Markov model (HMM) to infer the states of histone modification changes at each genomic location. We evaluated the performance of ChIPDiff by comparing the H3K27me3 modification sites between mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) and neural progenitor cell (NPC). We demonstrated that the H3K27me3 DHMSs identified by our approach are of high sensitivity, specificity and technical reproducibility. ChIPDiff was further applied to uncover the differential H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 sites between different cell states. Interesting biological discoveries were achieved from such comparison in our study.Availability: http://cmb.gis.a-star.edu.sg/ChIPSeq/tools.htmContact: asflin@ntu.edu.sg; sungk@gis.a-star.edu.sgSupplementary information: Supplementary methods and data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Motivation: Gene regulation commonly involves interaction among DNA, proteins and biochemical conditions. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technologies, protein–DNA interactions are routinely detected in the genome scale. Computational methods that detect weak protein-binding signals and simultaneously maintain a high specificity yet remain to be challenging. An attractive approach is to incorporate biologically relevant data, such as protein co-occupancy, to improve the power of protein-binding detection. We call the additional data related with the target protein binding as supporting tracks.Results: We propose a novel but rigorous statistical method to identify protein occupancy in ChIP data using multiple supporting tracks (PASS2). We demonstrate that utilizing biologically related information can significantly increase the discovery of true protein-binding sites, while still maintaining a desired level of false positive calls. Applying the method to GATA1 restoration in mouse erythroid cell line, we detected many new GATA1-binding sites using GATA1 co-occupancy data.Availability: http://stat.psu.edu/∼yuzhang/pass2.tarContact: yuzhang@stat.psu.edu},

abstract ={Motivation:ChIP-seq is becoming the main approach to the genome-wide study of protein–DNA interactions and histone modifications. Existing informatics tools perform well to extract strong ChIP-enriched sites. However, two questions remain to be answered: (i) to which extent is a ChIP-seq experiment able to reveal the weak ChIP-enriched sites? (ii) are the weak sites biologically meaningful? To answer these questions, it is necessary to identify the weak ChIP signals from background noise.Results: We propose a linear signal–noise model, in which a noise rate was introduced to represent the fraction of noise in a ChIP library. We developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using a control library, and derived a library-swapping strategy for the false discovery rate estimation. These approaches were integrated in a general-purpose framework, named CCAT (Control-based ChIP-seq Analysis Tool), for the significance analysis of ChIP-seq. Applications to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 datasets showed that CCAT predicted significantly more ChIP-enriched sites that the previous methods did. With the high sensitivity of CCAT prediction, we revealed distinct chromatin features associated to the strong and weak H3K4me3 sites.Availability: http://cmb.gis.a-star.edu.sg/ChIPSeq/tools.htmContact: sungk@gis.a-star.edu.sg; asflin@ntu.edu.sgSupplementary Information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Summary: Next-generation sequencing can provide insight into protein–DNA association events on a genome-wide scale, and is being applied in an increasing number of applications in genomics and meta-genomics research. However, few software applications are available for interpreting these experiments. We present here an efficient application for use with chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) experimental data that includes novel functionality for identifying areas of gene enrichment and transcription factor binding site locations, as well as for estimating DNA fragment size distributions in enriched areas. The FindPeaks application can generate UCSC compatible custom ‘WIG’ track files from aligned-read files for short-read sequencing technology. The software application can be executed on any platform capable of running a Java Runtime Environment. Memory requirements are proportional to the number of sequencing reads analyzed; typically 4 GB permits processing of up to 40 million reads.Availability: The FindPeaks 3.1 package and manual, containing algorithm descriptions, usage instructions and examples, are available at http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/findpeaks Source files for FindPeaks 3.1 are available for academic use.Contact: afejes@bcgsc.ca},

Discovering significant patterns in these data is an important problem for understanding biological mechanisms.Results: We propose probabilistic partitioning methods to discover significant patterns in ChIP-Seq data. Our methods take into account signal magnitude, shape, strand orientation and shifts. We compare our methods with some current methods and demonstrate significant improvements, especially with sparse data. Besides pattern discovery and classification, probabilistic partitioning can serve other purposes in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Specifically, we exemplify its merits in the context of peak finding and partitioning of nucleosome positioning patterns in human promoters.Availability and implementation: The software and code are available in the supplementary material.Contact: Philipp.Bucher@isb-sib.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Motivation: Post-translational modifications to histones have several well known associations with regulation of gene expression. While some modifications appear concentrated narrowly, covering promoters or enhancers, others are dispersed as epigenomic domains. These domains mark contiguous regions sharing an epigenomic property, such as actively transcribed or poised genes, or heterochromatically silenced regions. While high-throughput methods like ChIP-Seq have led to a flood of high-quality data about these epigenomic domains, there remain important analysis problems that are not adequately solved by current analysis tools.Results: We present the RSEG method for identifying epigenomic domains from ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications. In contrast with other methods emphasizing the locations of ‘peaks’ in read density profiles, our method identifies the boundaries of domains. RSEG is also able to incorporate a control sample and find genomic regions with differential histone modifications between two samples.Availability: RSEG, including source code and documentation, is freely available at http://smithlab.cmb.usc.edu/histone/rseg/.Contact: andrewds@usc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

volume = {29},

pages = {2979-2986}, 
year = {2013}, 
abstract ={Motivation: Cancer cells are often characterized by epigenetic changes, which include aberrant histone modifications. In particular, local or regional epigenetic silencing is a common mechanism in cancer for silencing expression of tumor suppressor genes. Though several tools have been created to enable detection of histone marks in ChIP-seq data from normal samples, it is unclear whether these tools can be efficiently applied to ChIP-seq data generated from cancer samples. Indeed, cancer genomes are often characterized by frequent copy number alterations: gains and losses of large regions of chromosomal material. Copy number alterations may create a substantial statistical bias in the evaluation of histone mark signal enrichment and result in underdetection of the signal in the regions of loss and overdetection of the signal in the regions of gain.Results: We present HMCan (Histone modifications in cancer), a tool specially designed to analyze histone modification ChIP-seq data produced from cancer genomes. HMCan corrects for the GC-content and copy number bias and then applies Hidden Markov Models to detect the signal from the corrected data. On simulated data, HMCan outperformed several commonly used tools developed to analyze histone modification data produced from genomes without copy number alterations. HMCan also showed superior results on a ChIP-seq dataset generated for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in a bladder cancer cell line. HMCan predictions matched well with experimental data (qPCR validated regions) and included, for example, the previously detected H3K27me3 mark in the promoter of the DLEC1 gene, missed by other tools we tested.Availability: Source code and binaries can be downloaded at http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hmcan/, implemented in C++.Contact: haitham.ashoor@kaust.edu.saSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

ABSTRACT = {The ChIP-seq technique enables genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions and chromatin states. Current analytical approaches for ChIP-seq analysis are largely geared towards single-sample investigations, and have limited applicability in comparative settings that aim to identify combinatorial patterns of enrichment across multiple datasets. We describe a novel probabilistic method, jMOSAiCS, for jointly analyzing multiple ChIP-seq datasets. We demonstrate its usefulness with a wide range of data-driven computational experiments and with a case study of histone modifications on GATA1-occupied segments during erythroid differentiation. jMOSAiCS is open source software and can be downloaded from Bioconductor [1].},

abstract ={The current understanding of the regulation of transcription does not keep the pace with the spectacular advances in the determination of genomic sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) promises to give better insight into transcription regulation by locating sites of protein–DNA interactions. Such loci of putative interactions can be inferred from the genome-wide distributions of ChIP-seq data by peak-calling software. The analysis of ChIP-seq data critically depends on this step and a multitude of these peak-callers have been deployed in the recent years. A recent study reported severe variation among peak-calling results. Yet, peak-calling still lacks systematic quantitative benchmarking. Here, we summarize benchmarking efforts and explain potential drawbacks of each benchmarking method.},
