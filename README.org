Brandon Dunn labeled ECG data sets
[[file:2019-05-brandon-labeled-ecg-data.tgz]]

Here are some ECG data with visual labels created by Brandon Dunn
during his independent study this semester. I would like to share them
with you because I think they will be useful for training and/or
testing machine learning algorithms for detecting the QRS complex.

- The ecg sub-directory has 8 noisy data sets in txt/csv format. the
  first three columns indicate the chromosome/start/end position and
  the fourth column is the noisy ECG measurement (millivolts).
- the labels sub-directory has 8 corresponding label files, one for
  each data set. The columns are as follows
1. user_id: the user ID of the person who created the label
   (bd288@nau.edu = Brandon Dunn).
2. profile_id: data set name (should be same as file name).
3-5. chromosome/min/max indicate the position of the label. chromosome
   is an artifact from my SegAnnDB labeling software which was
   originally designed for genomic data. In these data you just need
   to make sure to match the chromosome listed here (e.g. 3) with the
   corresponding value in the first column of the corresponding txt
   file (e.g. chr3).
6. type: ignore (should always be breakpoints).
7. annotation: label, indicates what should be predicted in the
   corresponding region. e.g. R-peak means that exactly 1 R-peak
   should be predicted in [min,max] on the corresponding chromosome.

Given any model/prediction, we can use these data to compute false
positive / false negative rates / ROC curves / AUC, along with
prediction accuracy (in terms of number/percent correctly predicted
labels). False positive R-peak label = two or more R predicted in that
region. False negative R-peak label = zero R predicted in that region.

Overall there are 8 time series with 2007 labeled regions.
